  Why are we here? well we're in the middle of another transition. Ember Addons are an incredibly important part of the ecosystem and in my opinion are one of the things that makes Ember great üéâ The things you could do with an addon evolved both technically and culturally very organically over the years but nobody really took a step back and though about the overall architecture or philosopy for a long time, not until embroider came along!

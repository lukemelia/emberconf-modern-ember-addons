  I'm not entirely sure what to expect out of this workshop since since there is so so so much to cover, but what I'm hoping for is that y'all leave here with a good idea of how to think about modern addons, why they have changed so much between the classic v1 and v2 versions and at least have a foot hold on an idea of what is possible with modern addons. I'll also make sure that y'all know of all the good places to go to find out the information that you need if you get stuck building your own amazing addons in the next few months.

  any questions before I proceed? 

  Ok so what I'm hoping to cover today splits into two sections and I'm hopfully going to split those evenly in half one hour each. First I'm going to go over some of the capabilities of the new v2 addon blueprint. If you generate one right now you'll see there is a lot going on and I want to give you the tour. 

  The second thing I want to dive into is the more involved kind of addon. In ember-cli and v1 addons we could automatically influence the build in weird and wonderful ways, but you can't do that any more. You can still influnce the build, but it's not quite automatic. But we'll dive in a bit more when we get there.
